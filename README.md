This consists of short bits of code (that are not really meant to be used or downloaded together) to run the robots from varius capstone projects.

Golf-Ball-Dispenser: when downloaded, it does as one would expect and continually dispenses golf balls. 

snacbotauto: this just opens all the containers, keeps it open for a couple of seconds (so one can take our his or her snack) then closes all of the containers. 

snacbotservo: publisher & suscriber method of controlling snacbot boxes w/ rosserial & arduino

If you want to run the snacbot w/ the turtlebot & the app, you can find it here: https://github.com/FSGRIS
