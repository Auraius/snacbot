This consists of short bits of code (that are not really meant to be used or downloaded together) to run the robots from varius capstone projects.

auto: no interaction, just runs the motors repetedly. These work. 

servo: uses roserial & arduino to run motors. You publish a topic through the terminal. Note: because I just changed the snacbot one & just finished the golf one both of them still need to be tested out!!!
