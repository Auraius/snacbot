This consists of short bits of code (that are not really meant to be used or downloaded together) to run the robots from varius capstone projects.

auto: no interaction, just runs the motors repetedly. These work. 

servo: uses roserial & arduino to run motors. You publish a topic through the terminal. Note: because I just changed the snacbot code & just finished the golf code both of the code uploaded still needs to be tested out!!! Yo need to do the arduino IDE setup which can be found here: http://wiki.ros.org/rosserial_arduino/Tutorials/Arduino%20IDE%20Setup
