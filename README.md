This consists of short bits of code (that are not really meant to be used together) to run the robots from varius capstone projects.

auto: no interaction, just runs the motors (has the devices run) repetedly

servo: uses roserial & arduino to run motors (control the devices). You need to do the arduino IDE setup prior to this. This code is really sloppy right now-- I will change that a bit later.
